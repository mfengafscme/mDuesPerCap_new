<TABLE class="DataFONT" align="center" width="100%">

<!-- BEGIN CHANGE -->
<p>This screen lists the mailing list reports that the user has access to. Basic information on the 
report(s) is provided such as Name, Description, Last Updated User Id and Last Updated Date. If the 
report name appears as a link (underlined), click on the report name to initiate processing for the report.</p> 

<p>Before initiating processing for the report, the user may elect to check the Do Not Send 
Duplicate Addresses check box. Checking this box will cause a basic algorithm to be executed that 
detects and groups duplicate addresses into a single mailing address.</p>

<p>Note that the user will only see reports that they have been granted access to generate. </p>

<p>At the bottom of the screen is a section labeled My Mailing Lists. This section may contain 
saved queries from the Maintain Queries functionality.  Saved queries are those the user created, 
saved and marked as mailing lists. </p>
