Power Member Search Help

<TABLE class="DataFONT" align="center" width="100%">
<TR>
<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to search for Members based on the most common 
search criteria.

<BR/><BR/>
This screen has the following "editable" fields in the 'Fields to Search' section:
First Name, Middle Name and Last Name of the Member, Prefix (pull down menu), 
Suffix (pull down menu), Affiliate Identifier-Finder section with Type (pull down menu), 
Local/Sub Chapter (text box), State/National Type (pull down menu), Sub Unit (text box) 
and Council/Retiree Chapter (text box). 
<BR/>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier 
search. Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields must be entered before selecting 
the Finder link. When the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search 
in a new browser window. By selecting a result in that window, the window closes and the 
selected Affiliate Identifier is returned to the original screen and populates the associated 
Affiliate Identifier fields. 

<BR/><BR/>

The System Mailing Mailing Address section allows entry for Address 1, Address 2 (if applicable), 
City, State, and Zip/Postal code in the appropriate boxes. A date for Last Updated can be selected 
by clicking on the icon "Date Picker". The Updated By box accepts a userid.

<BR/><BR/>

The General Member Information section allows entry of the Member Nickname, Alternate Mailing Name, 
Member Number, SSN, and Valid SSN.  Phone number contains fields for Country Code, Area Code and Number. Other fields include Email 
Address, Primary Information Source, Member Type, Member Status, Date Membership Card Sent,
Member Last Updated and Member Updated By.  The Mail Flags contain four categories: Mail, 
Legislative Mail, Cards and Public Employee. Cards and Public Employee are NOT for Affiliates users.

<BR/><BR/>

The Fields to Display section identifies the fields to be shown in the Member Search Results screen. 
The following fields are the "default" values to display and are checked: First Name, Middle Name, 
Last name, Suffix, Affiliate Identifier, Member Status, Member Number, and System Mailing Address. 
Name, System Mailing Address, Affiliate Identifier, Member Type, Member Status and Member Number. 

<BR/><BR/>

To perform a search, at least one field must contain data.

<BR/><BR/>

Wildcard searches on Last Name are allowed only at the end of the name using the percent sign, i.e. Jone%. Wildcard
	searches on First Name are also allowed in the same manner as the Last Name, but must be used in conjunction with a
	search of another field.

<BR/><BR/>

The affiliate finder can be used to look up affiliates based on the data entered in the affiliate identifier fields.
	The displayed results can be used to select a single affiliate to filter the member search. If searching across
	multiple affiliates is required, use the affiliate identifier fields without using the affiliate identifier. For
	example, to search for a member across all affiliates in council 10, enter only the council in the affiliate
	identifier fields. The affiliate finder is used to set a single affiliate to search. If the
 	user modifies the affiliate identifier, the affiliate identifier on the screen will be used to constrain the
	search. If an affiliate identifier for an affiliate does not exist, the effect will be no
	results that match the search.
	
<BR/><BR/>

If Affiliate Relations Home Phone Number is selected under the Fields to Display section,
the Member Search Results screen will display the home phone number entered by Affiliate Relations.  
If one does not exist, the fields will be blank.  If Primary Email is selected under the Fields to 
Display section, the Member Search Results screen will display the Member's Primary Email Address.

<BR/><BR/>
