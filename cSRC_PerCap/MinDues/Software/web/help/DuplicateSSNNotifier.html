The Duplicate Social Security Notifier screen allows the user to view persons with the same Social 
Security Number (SSN) as a person being added or edited. A person being added may be added with a SSN that 
is the same as another person or persons already in the system. A person being edited may already have a 
duplicate SSN or may have a SSN entered that duplicates one in the system. </BR></BR>

This screen displays basic information on one or more persons with the same SSN. The user will not see 
the screen if no persons are detected in the system with the same SSN. The user may view the person(s) 
displayed or decide to continue to add or edit the person. To continue with the save, the user selects 
the Continue button and the save will complete and all of the persons identified with the same SSN will
have a flag set to indicate that a duplicate SSN exists in the system. If the user wants to cancel the 
current add or edit operation, the user selects the Cancel button. The user may also wish to explore 
more information about one of the persons with a duplicate SSN displayed on the screen. The user may 
select the View link next to one of the persons displayed on the screen. 

All actions (buttons or links) are available based on the user's privileges.
