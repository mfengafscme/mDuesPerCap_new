<BR/><BR/>Enter a Certified Mail Number, if available, in the associated field when applicable.
<BR/><BR/>If checked, the Request Denied (checkbox) activates the Reason Denied pull down menu and

Summary and cannot be edited.</li>

<BR/><BR/>

<li>If from the Political Rebate Summary By Year and the screen is part of the Add New Year flow, 
the value defaults to the previous calendar year but is editable and can be changed to a prior year.</li>

<BR/><BR/>

All required fields must be entered, which includes at least one full Affiliate Identifier.

<BR/><BR/>

The Keyed Date defaults to the current date and cannot be edited.

<BR/><BR/>

If Request Denied is checked, Reason Denied and Date Denied become editable, the Reason Denied is 
required and the Date Denied is required and defaults to the current date.

<BR/><BR/>

The lower section of the screen provides three 'Dues Paid To' fields and has the following 
sub categories: Type and State/National, Local/Sub Chapter and Council/Retiree Chapter.  
The Duration and Filed With fields also have pull down menus for making the appropriate selections.  
There is an additional field for Comments.

<BR/><BR/>

The only allowable values for Affiliate Type under Dues Paid To is ‘L’ for Local, 
‘R’ for Retiree Chapter, and ‘S’ for Retiree Sub Chapter.

<BR/><BR/>

A Person/Member cannot request a Rebate for more than 3 Affiliates across all Requests for the Rebate Year.
