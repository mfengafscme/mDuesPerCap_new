The Edit User Screen allows an administrator to edit a user's login account. For AFSCME Enterprise 
Release 1, all users are persons within the system. There are several key actions that an administrator 
can take on an user's account. These include: 

<BR/>
<UL>	
	<li> Change the user's userid.  Note that the user will not be able to access the system through 
		their account unless they are given the new userid. </li>
	<li> Reset the user's password.  Note that the user will not be able to access the system unless 
		they are given the new password, or receive a new password through the "forgot password" mechanism.  </li>
	<li> View the roles assigned to the user </li>
	<li> Display the screen which allows roles to be selected for the user. Associating a role with a 
		user gives the user all privileges associated with that role. </li>
	<li> Display the screen which allows affiliates to be selected for the user. Having a user 
		affiliate association enables the user to use the affiliate view data utility. </li>
	<li> Associating an AFSCME department with a user. A user department association indicates that 
		the user is an AFSCME staff user. Certain system access controls are keyed by the user's department. </li>
</UL>

<p>Some terminology descriptions may be of assistance in using this screen. </p>
<p>A <i>privilege</i> is the ability of a user to execute an action within the system, such as a 
link or a button. These actions in turn are used to control what screens a user can access. </p>
A <i>role</i> is a named collection of privileges which provides convenient groupings of privileges to 
grant users. A user may be granted several roles, the sets of privileges are additive. </p>

<p>In addition, users may have different starting screens. An AFSCME staff user has access to the 
AFSCME main menu as a starting screen. An AFSCME Staff user, from an access control 
perspective, is any user who is associated with an AFSCME department. </p>
<p>An Affiliate staff user has access to the data utility main menu as a starting screen. An 
Affiliate staff user is any user who has a user affiliate association. </p>
<p>An AFSCME member user has access to the My Personal Information screen as a starting screen 
unless turned off by the affiliate. </p>
<p>A user may have access to more than one starting screen (e.g. be an AFSCME staff user, an 
affiliate staff user and a member). In this case, the Edit User screen allows the starting screen 
to be set for the user. If the starting screen is not set, the default starting screen will be 
used for that user. For an AFSCME staff user, the default starting screen is the AFSCME Main Menu. 
For an Affiliate staff user who is not an AFSCME staff user, the Data Utility Main Menu is the 
starting screen. For an AFSCME member who is neither of the other types of users, 
the My Personal Information screen is the starting screen.</p>

<p>Access as an AFSCME staff user to the AFSCME Main Menu or as an Affiliate staff user to the 
Data Utility Main Menu does not necessarily convey privileges to access other screens. To use 
other screens, the user is granted one or more roles. A user that sees a nearly empty AFSCME 
Main Menu or Data Utility Main Menu most likely has not been granted any roles (and thus no privileges). </p>
