<BR/><BR/>

If an Affiliate Identifier was entered by the user without using the Affiliate Finder functionality, 
The Duplicate Affiliate Identifier Notifier screen will display whenever multiple results are found.  
This can also occur in the case of adding a new Affiliate when the hierarchy implied by the new 
Affiliate Identifier matches multiple Affiliates above the new Affiliate in the hierarchy.

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
