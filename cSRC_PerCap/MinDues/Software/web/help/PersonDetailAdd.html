Person Detail Add Help

<BR/><BR/>
This screen provides the user the ability to add a new Person.

<p>Data that was entered on the Verify Person screen will be prepopulated in their respective fields on this screen.
<p>If the Person being added has a value entered for Social Security Number, the system will check if that Social Security Number already exists. If it does already exist, the system will show the Duplicate SSN Notifier screen before performing the requested action, thus allowing the user to continue or cancel the action. If the user elects to continue the action, the records that match are flagged as duplicates.
<p>If one of the Address fields is populated, the following rules will be validated:
<LI>If Country is Canada, the City and Province are required.</LI>
<LI>If one of the Phone fields is populated, then all of the remaining Phone fields are required.</LI>
