Member Detail Edit Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to edit a Member’s information.

<P>Fields not updateable on this screen such as the System Mailing Address, Member/Affiliate 
Associations, Phone Numbers and Email Addresses can be updated through other functionality off of the 
Member Detail screen.

<p>All required fields must be entered. 
 
<p>If the Person being added has a value entered for Social Security Number, the system will 
check if that Social Security Number already exists. If it does already exist, the system will 
display the Duplicate SSN Notifier screen before saving any changes to allow the user to continue 
or cancel the action. If the user elects to continue the action, the records that match are flagged as 
duplicates.

<p>If Barred Flag is checked, the Member can be active, but cannot hold an Office.

<p>If a Member is in an affiliate with an affiliate status of Deactivated, the only valid status 
for that Member is Inactive.

<p><b>NOTE:</B>	Under the Affiliate View Data Utility(VDU) for the current Member, only their 
affiliations within the user’s current data hierarchy will be displayed.  Any Member affiliation 
for that person outside of the Affiliate Hierarchy of the VDU User will not be displayed.  The
Affiliate Hierarchy is determined by the affiliate the user entered the Affiliate View Data Utility through.

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the
