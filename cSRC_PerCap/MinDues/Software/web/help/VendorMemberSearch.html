Vendor Member Search Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen will provide an outside Vendor the ability to search for Members with limited access 
to the Member's information and also gives the user the ability to navigate the results, sort the results, 
or initiate a new search.  

<p>When the user first comes to this screen, only the Search section is displayed. 
The List of Results section appears only after the user submits search criteria. 
The Search section remains along with the List of Results section, so that more searches can be 
performed.

<BR/><BR/>
This screen has the following "editable" fields: The 'Fields to Search' section allows the user to enter the 
First Name, Middle Name and Last name of the member in the fields below each title. Additional 
"editable" fields include Member Number, Social Security Number, City, State and Zip/Postal Code. 

<p>The Affiliate Identifier-Finder section displays Type (pull down menu), Local/Sub Chapter box to be 
filled in, State/National Type (pull down menu), Sub Unit box to enter data and Council/Retiree 
Chapter box to be filled in. 
<p>Due to the number and size of fields to display, the user may be required to scroll to the right to 
view all of the fields.</p>

<p>The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier search. 
Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields must be entered before selecting the Finder link. 
When the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search in a new browser window. 
When a result is selected, the window closes and the selected Affiliate Identifier is returned to the 
original screen and populated in the associated Affiliate Identifier fields. 

<p>The affiliate finder can be used to look up affiliates based on the data entered in the affiliate 
identifier fields.	The displayed results can be used to select a single affiliate to filter the member 
search. If searching across	multiple affiliates is required, use the affiliate identifier fields 
without using the affiliate identifier. For	example, to search for a member across all affiliates in 
council 10, enter only the council in the affiliate	identifier fields. The affiliate finder can be used 
to set a single affiliate to search. If the affiliate identifier needs to be modified, the affiliate 
identifier on the screen will be used to constrain the search. If an affiliate identifier for an 
affiliate does not exist, the effect will be no results that match the search.

<p>To perform a search, at least one field must contain data.

<P>The 'Search Results' section displays the Member Status, Name, Address, City, State,
zip/Postal code, Affiliate Identifier with the following sub categories/columns: 
Type, Local/Sub, State/Nat'l, Sub Unit and CN/Ret Chap, Member Number and Member Type.  The address 
displayed is the Member's System Mailing Address.

<p>Initial sort order will be by Name (Last Name then  First Name) ascending alphabetically, State 
ascending alphabetically, Council ascending numerically and Local ascending numerically.

<p>The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen 
<U>depending on the user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
