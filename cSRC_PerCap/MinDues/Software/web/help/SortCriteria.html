This screen provides the user the ability to define sort criteria for any of the fields the 
user has selected on the "Sort Criteria Fields" screen.  This screen will not display any fields 
if the user has not selected any fields on the "Sort Criteria Fields" screen.  This screen will 
not be available if the user has selected "Count Query" on the "Output Fields" screen.

<P>The values in the Sort Order fields are determined by the total number of data fields selected 
on the "Sort Criteria Fields" screen.  For each field selected in the "Sort Criteria Fields" screen, 
the user can identify the sort order the result set will be displayed and the whether the result 
should be in ascending or descending order.

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the
