The Location Selection screen allows the user to view basic information pertaining to the location associated with an entity such as an Organization associate. The page displays all locations associated with an organization. If the entity has been associated with a location previously, that location is displayed with the text "Current" next to it. Other locations are displayed with the underlined text "Select"(signifying an action) next to them. If no locations are currently associated with the organization the page will be displayed without any locations.
