Preview Query Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user the ability to preview a query and the option to save or cancel this query.  

<p>Query Name cannot contain a space or start with strange character.  Use an underscore ("_") instead of space.</p>
<p>If the user selects the "Mailing List" checkbox, the system enables the "Update Correspondence History" checkbox.
If the user unselects the "Mailing List" checkbox, the system shall uncheck (if it is checked) and disable the "Update Correspondence History" checkbox.</p>
<p>If the user clicks "Save As" button, the system enforces the rule that the "Query Name" cannot be the same as any query that already exists.</p>

<p>The report section will dynamically be created based on the query created.  The Output fields are 
displayed in, if defined, the order provided and the result set is limited based on any selection 
criteria identified and shown in the sort order defined. </p>

<p>If the user had selected "Count Query", the only output data field for the query is "Count".  
If the "Count Query" had been selected, all the data fields on the screen shall be disabled and the 
"Output Fields Order", "Sort Criteria Fields", and "Sort Criteria" links on the top of screen shall 
be disabled on all screens within the wizard chain for the Maintain Queries functionality. </p>

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The "Mailing List" and "Update Correspondence History" fields will not be available if the user is an affiliate user.</p>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
