The Basic Person Search screen allows the user to enter common search criteria to retrieve matching 
Person records.  If the search returns more than one row, the results of the search will be 
displayed on the Person Search Results screen.  If there is only one matching record, the 
system will take the user directly to the Person Detail screen.  If no record matches the search 
criteria, the Verify Person screen will display to start the process of adding 
a Person to the system.<BR/><BR/>

There are a number of important things to note about this screen.<BR/><BR/>
<ul>
	<li>At least one search criteria must be entered before a search is allowed.</li><BR/><BR/>
	<li>Entering search values in multiple fields will narrow the search.  
		For example, entering only the value "Jefferson" in the Last Name field will return 
		all persons in the system with the last name of Jefferson.  <U>NOTE</U>: The quote marks 
		displayed around "Jefferson" are for emphasis only.  In the application, enter text 
		values without the surrounding quotes.  Entering "Thomas" in the First Name field 
		and "Jefferson" in the Last Name field, will return only those persons whose first 
		name is Thomas and whose last name is Jefferson.</li><BR/><BR/>  
	<li><U><I>Wildcard searches</I></U> are 
		allowed only in the Last Name and First Name fields. Wildcard searches are allowed on 
		Last Name by entering a % at the end (and only the end) of a partial name. For example, 
		entering "Jeffer%" would return all persons whose last name began with Jeffer. This 
		might include last names such as Jeffers, Jefferson, Jeffersons, Jefferman. <U>A wild card 
		can be used at the end of a partial name in the First Name field, but must be used in 
		conjunction with another search criteria</U>.  For example, if "Sam%" is entered in the 
		First Name field, and "Hoffman" in the Last Name field, the return displays results for 
		all persons in the system with a Last Name of Hoffman and a First Name that starts with 
		Sam, i.e. Sam Hoffman, Sammie Hoffman, Samuel Hoffman.<BR/><BR/>  </li>
</ul>

The screen contains the following <U>Fields</U> for entering search criteria:<BR/>
