AFSCME Enterprise Privacy Policy<BR/><BR/> 

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that 
we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy.
The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages owned and operated by AFSCME.  The following
discloses our Privacy Policy. <BR/><BR/>

 
<b>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</b><BR/><BR/>

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that
computer's "Internet Protocol" <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html">IP address</a>. 
When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the
AFSCME Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The
domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you
have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate
misuse of the AFSCME Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also <b>Will you disclose 
the information you collect to outside third parties?</b> We do not collect and evaluate this information for 
specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.<BR/><BR/> 

<b>What are cookies?</b><BR/><BR/>
 
From time to time, AFSCME may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is
sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't
read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not 
damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of AFSCME's Network you have visited or 
customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible.  You can choose whether to
accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these
cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not
work as intended.<BR/><BR/>

<b>What information do you request?</b><BR/><BR/>			
				  
We may request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to
provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or
information about conferences). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the
purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means
that we do not sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or as
permitted by this Privacy Policy.<BR/><BR/>

AFSCME will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. If you choose to supply your postal
address in an online form, you will not receive postal mailings from other third party companies.<BR/><BR/>

<b>Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?</b><BR/><BR/>

AFSCME will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith
belief that such action is necessary to:
<ol>
<li>Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities and conform to the edicts of the law 
or comply with legal process served on AFSCME,
</li>
<li>
Protect and defend the rights or property of the AFSCME Network of sites and related properties, or
visitors to the AFSCME Network of sites and related properties,
</li>
<li>
Identify persons who may be violating the law, the AFSCME legal notice and Web site User
Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the AFSCME Network or its related properties.
</li></ol>
AFSCME uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us is secure.<BR/><BR/>

<b>Your Consent To This Agreement</b><BR/><BR/>

By using the AFSCME Network, you consent to the collection and use of information by AFSCME as
specified above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that
you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we
disclose it.<BR/><BR/>
