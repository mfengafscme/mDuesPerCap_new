<BR/><BR/>

All required fields must be entered, which includes at least one full Affiliate Identifier.

<BR/><BR/>

If the Return Date is populated, the Evaluation Code cannot be "Not Returned".

<BR/><BR/>

If the Return Date is greater than the system configured timeframe, usually 35 days, from the 
Mailed Date, the Evaluation Code is set to "Not Timely".  The system configured timeframe must be set by
a Administrator of the system.

<BR/><BR/>

The only allowable values for Affiliate Type under Dues Paid To is ‘L’ for Local, 
‘R’ for Retiree Chapter, and ‘S’ for Retiree Sub Chapter.

<BR/><BR/>

If the Affiliate Finder functionality is not used to build the fields of the Affiliate Identifier 
and duplicate Affiliates are found for the data entered, the system will display the Duplicate 
Affiliate Identifier Notifier Screen as part of the flow to allow selection of the correct Affiliate.
