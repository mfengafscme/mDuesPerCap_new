<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user the ability to select data fields for defining sort criteria.  
This screen will not be available if the user has selected "Count Query" on the "Output Fields" screen.

<P>There are four sections, Person, Member, Officer and Affiliate, on this screen with each 
containing a pre-determined list of fields. The system provides composite fields of 
"Full Name", "Full Address", and "Full Phone Number" in Person fields and the system provides 
composite fields for "Affiliate Identifier", "Primary Location Address" and "Primary Location 
Phone Number" in the Affiliate fields.

<P>Clicking the heading of each sub section will select/de-select all the fields within that heading.

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>
  
The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
