Basic Member Search Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the ability to search for Members based on the most common search criteria.

<BR/><BR/>
This screen has the following "editable" fields in the 'Fields to Search' section:
First Name, Middle Name and Last Name of the Member, a Suffix with a pull down menu, Affiliate 
Identifier-Finder section with Type (pull down menu), Local/Sub Chapter (text box), 
State/National Type (pull down menu), Sub Unit (text box) and Council/Retiree Chapter (text box). 

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier 
search. Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields must be entered before selecting 
the Finder link. When the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search 
in a new browser window. By selecting a result in that window, the window closes and the 
selected Affiliate Identifier is returned to the original screen and populates the associated 
Affiliate Identifier fields. 

<p>The next section contains boxes to enter the following General Membership Information: 
Member Number, Social Security Number, and State (System Mailing Address). 

<p>The last group of fields are the 'Fields to display' which identify the fields to be shown in the 
Member Search Results screen. The following fields are the "default" values to display and are 
checked: Name, Affiliate Identifier, Member Type, Member Status, Member Number, and System Mailing Address.</p>

To perform a search, at least one field must contain data.<BR/><BR/>
 
Wildcard searches on Last Name are allowed only at the end of the name using the percent sign, i.e. Jone%. Wildcard
	searches on First Name are also allowed in the same manner as the Last Name, but must be used in conjunction with a
	search of another field. <BR/><BR/>

The affiliate finder can be used to look up affiliates based on the data entered in the affiliate identifier fields.
	The displayed results can be used to select a single affiliate to filter the member search. If searching across
	multiple affiliates is required, use the affiliate identifier fields without using the affiliate identifier. For
	example, to search for a member across all affiliates in council 10, enter only the council in the affiliate
	identifier fields. The affiliate finder is used to set a single affiliate to search. If the
 	user modifies the affiliate identifier, the affiliate identifier on the screen will be used to constrain the
	search. If an affiliate identifier for an affiliate does not exist, the effect will be no
	results that match the search.<BR/><BR/>
	
<p>The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
