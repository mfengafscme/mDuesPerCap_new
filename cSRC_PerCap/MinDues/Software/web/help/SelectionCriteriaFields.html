Selection Criteria Fields Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user the ability to choose data fields for selection criteria.  

<P>There are four sections, Person, Member, Officer and Affiliate, on this screen with each 
containing a pre-determined list of fields. The system provides composite fields of 
"Full Name", "Full Address", and "Full Phone Number" in Person fields and the system provides 
composite fields for "Affiliate Identifier", "Primary Location Address" and "Primary Location 
Phone Number" in the Affiliate fields.

<P>Clicking the heading of each sub section will select/de-select all the fields within that heading.

<p>For Affiliate fields, only the Primary Location is searched for Address and Phone.  Additionally, 
the Created User ID/Date and Last Updated User ID/Date listed under Affiliate Detail searches 
only for core Affiliate Detail screen modifications which does not include associated affiliate 
information.</p>

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>

<p>The user does not need to choose any field on this screen to proceed to the next step.</p>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
