If a name is entered and multiple results are found upon searching, a link is provided to view the search results and make a selection.  If the name is changed in any way after returning from the search results, the search must be performed again.

<BR/><BR/>
If multiple office updates are made and submitted at once, all renew and vacate transactions, as well as all replace transactions that return one search result will be processed.  A replace transaction that returns multiple results will not stop the processing.  A message will be shown indicating that all transactions have been processed except for those showing multiple result messages.
