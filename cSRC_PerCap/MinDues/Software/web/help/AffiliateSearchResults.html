The Affiliate Search Results screen provides the user with the ability to view the results of a 
Basic Affiliate Search or a Power Affiliate Search and gives the user the ability to navigate 
the results, sort the results, view the details of an individual result, or initiate a new search.  

<BR/><BR/>
The system displays the results <U><I>sorted</U></I> by the field the user selected. 
If the results were already sorted by the field the user selected, 
they should be displayed in the reverse order. 
Otherwise, the results are displayed as sorted in ascending order based upon the field the user selected.  

<BR/><BR/>
Sort fields are:
<UL>
<LI>Affiliate Name</LI>
<LI>Affiliate Type</LI>
<LI>Local/Sub Chapter</LI>
<LI>State/National Type</LI>
<LI>Sub Unit</LI>
<LI>Council/Retiree Chapter</LI>
