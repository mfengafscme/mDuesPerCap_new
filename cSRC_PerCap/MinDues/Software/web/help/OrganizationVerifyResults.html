Organization Verify Results Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to view the results of the search entered in the 
Verify Organization screen and is part of the Add flow for Organizations.

<P>This is a three column screen. The Select column allows the user to select "View" an Organization to 
see detailed information. The remaining columns are Organization Name and Organization Type. 
These fields have "links" that allow the system to display the results sorted by that column. 
If the results were already sorted by that column, the results should be displayed in the reverse order. 
Otherwise, the results are displayed as sorted in ascending order based upon that column. 

<P>	Initial sort order will be by Organization Name ascending alphabetically.

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
