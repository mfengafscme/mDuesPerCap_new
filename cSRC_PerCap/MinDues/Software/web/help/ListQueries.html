<p>This screen lists the stored queries that the user has created previously. Basic information on the 
queries is provided such as Name, Description, Last Updated User Id and Last Updated Date. 
If no queries have been saved/stored, the column headers will display the all rows representing 
stored queries as blank.</p>

<p>The Add Query button can be used to start the process of creating a query. Please note that 
the user can create and run a query without saving the query.  This is useful for one time use queries. 
If the query is not saved, it will not show up on this screen. </p>
