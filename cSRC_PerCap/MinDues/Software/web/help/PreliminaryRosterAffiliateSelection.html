This screen provides the user the ability to view a list of Affiliates 
that have Preliminary Roster and/or Rebate Update File records, and allows
the user to select the Affiliate(s) from the list.  Once the Affiliate is 
selected and submitted, a Preliminary Roster report and a Rebate Update File 
report will be generated.  These reports contain a listing of individuals 
that have requested Political Rebates for Membership within the selected Affiliates.
