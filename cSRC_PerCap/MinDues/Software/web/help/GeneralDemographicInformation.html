This screen provides General Demographic Information for the current person.  
This screen is primarily for viewing this information.  The General Demographic - Edit 
screen provides the ability to edit this information.  Additional children are 
added through this screen, while information on a spouse is added and edited 
through the General Demographic - Edit screen.  Information on existing children 
can be updated through the General Demographic - Edit screen as well.<BR/><BR/> 

This screen contains general demographic information such as Birth Date, 
Deceased Date, Marital Status and Ethnic Origin.<BR/><BR/>
    
In the current release of the AFSCME Enterprise Application, Spouse and Children are not 
recorded as Person records and consequently will not show up through a Person search.
