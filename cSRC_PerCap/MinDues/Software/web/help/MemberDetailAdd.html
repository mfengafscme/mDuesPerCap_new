<TITLE>Help: Member Detail Add</TITLE>

<H1>
Member Detail Add Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to add a new Member which includes adding 
them as a new Person to the system. 

<p>All required fields must be entered. 
 
<p>The Affiliate Identifier must exist in the system.

<p>The Affiliate must have a status of either Chartered, Not Chartered, Restricted 	
Administratorship, or Unrestricted Administratorship to be valid.

<p>The Member Type can only be ‘Retiree’ and ‘Retiree Spouse’ if Affiliate Type is ‘R’ or ‘S’. 

<p>If the Person being added has a value entered for Social Security Number, the system 
will check if that Social Security Number already exists. If it does already exist, 
the system will show the Duplicate SSN Notifier screen before performing the requested action, 
thus allowing the user to continue or cancel the action. If continuing the action, the records 
that match are flagged as duplicates.

<p>If the Affiliate Finder functionality is not used to build the fields of the Affiliate Identifier 
and duplicate Affiliates are found for the data entered, the system will display the Duplicate Affiliate 
Identifier Notifier Screen as part of the flow to allow the user to indicate the correct Affiliate. 
Once the choice is made, the flow continues with the requested action.

<p>If one of the Address fields is populated, the system will validate the following rules:
<ul>
	<li>If Country is Canada, the Province is required.</li>
	<li>If one of the Phone fields is populated, then all of the remaining Phone fields are required.</li>
</ul>

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
