Person Detail Edit Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>


The Person Detail Edit screen provides the user with the ability to edit a Person’s information 
if the user has the necessary administrative privileges. The "note" at the bottom of the screen 
identifies that any fields marked with an asterisk are required.  On this screen the required fields 
are: First Name and Last Name. If data is not entered in the required fields, an error message will 
be generated and displayed.

<p>Fields available to edit/update Person information include: First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, 
Suffix, Nickname, Social Security Number (SSN), Alternate Mail Name and Comments. This screen 
also allows the user to mark (using checkboxes) an address as bad, mark the Person record for 
deletion and mark the social security number as valid or a duplicate.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> If the Person whose details are being edited has a value entered for 
Social Security Number, the system will check if that Social Security Number already exists. 
If it does already exist, the system will show the Duplicate SSN Notifier screen before performing 
the requested action to allow the user to continue or cancel the action. By choosing to continue 
the action, the records that match will be flagged as duplicates.

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
privileges set by the Admin functionality for the user</U>.
