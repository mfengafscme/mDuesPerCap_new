Address Maintenance Help

<BR/><BR/>

The Address Maintenance screen provides the user with the ability to view or delete an address 
associated with an individual.  Addresses are displayed by Department that created the address.  A
Department can only update and remove address associated with their Department.  

<BR/><BR/>

On this screen the "primary" address is determined by the computer to be the "best" system mail 
address. It is the address that will be used to mail AFSCME material to this Person.

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
