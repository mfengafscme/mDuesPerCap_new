<!-- BEGIN CHANGE -->
<p>The Enable Mass Change screen allows a number of mass change operations to be initiated. Mass Change 
operations are scheduled operations which means based on system configuration parameters the system 
runs mass change operations at a later time. One reason that Mass Change operations are scheduled, is 
that they typically modify a large number of records. Modifying large numbers of records at one time 
uses resources and potentially locks records desired by other users and can result in poor performance 
for users of the AFSCME Enterprise Application.  The AFSCME Enterprise Application Operators set the 
times that the mass change operations will run. </p>

<p>The term <i>sub-affiliates</i> is a generic term that is used to describe the "children" or affiliates 
that are associated and report to other affiliates in hierarchy. For example, the sub-affiliates of a 
council include all locals directly related to that affiliate and all sub-units related to any of the 
locals related to the council.</p>

<p>To select a particular mass change operation to perform, the user must first select whether they wish 
to perform an Affiliate Status change or Other Mass Change Types by selecting the appropriate radio 
button. </p>

<p>Some operations require an affiliate identifier to be input, such as Merge and Split operations. 
For these two operations, the affiliate finder functionality is provided. The affiliate finder 
functionality allows the user to input partial affiliate identifier information, such as the state, 
and then returns a list of matching affiliates from which the user can select an affiliate to 
populate the associated affiliate identifier fields. If the user enters affiliate identifier 
information and does not use the finder functionality, and more than one affiliate matches the 
information entered, the user will be taken to the Duplicate Affiliate Identifier Notifier screen 
where the user can select the affiliate intended.  </p>

AFSCME Mass Change Operations include:
<TABLE class="DataFONT" align="center" width="95%">
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Set To Merge </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Merge the members of the current affiliate (the one the user is working with) 
		with another affiliate. The user must enter the affiliate identifier of the affiliate 
		to which the members will be moved. This operation is only valid for Locals and Retiree 
		Sub Chapters. The current affiliate will then have its status set to Merged.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Set to Split </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Splits the current affiliate (that the user is working with) and associates 
		it with a different affiliate. The user must enter the affiliate identifier of the new 
		affiliate to which the association will be made. The Split operation can only be performed 
		when the current affiliate is a Sub Local. Upon completion of this operation, the sub local 
		status is set to Split.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Set to Deactivated </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Sets the status of all members of the affiliate to Inactive. When performing 
		the deactivation on a council, mass change deactivates the Council and disassociates all of 
		its Sub-Affiliates. This disassociation will result in the Sub-Affiliate’s Affiliate 
		Identifier Council field being set to blank.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Membership Information Reporting Source </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Modify the Membership Information Reporting Source for the current affiliate 
		and all its members.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Unit Wide No Member Cards </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Modify the Unit Wide No Member Card flag for the affiliate and all its members.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Unit Wide No PE Mail </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Modify the Unit Wide No PE Mail for the affiliate and all its members.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Retiree Annual Dues Renewal </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Sets or unsets this flag for the affiliate. Valid only for Retiree Chapters 
		and Retiree Sub Chapters.</TD>
	</TR>
    <TR valign="top">
		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B><U>Affiliate Identifier </U></B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH="51%">Allows the affiliate identifier to be changed for the affiliate.
		Examples of using the Affiliate Identifier option include changing the Affiliate Number to an 
		appropriate one for an affiliate. For a council or Retiree Chapter, this means the 
		Council\Retiree Chapter field can be changed. For a Local or Retiree Sub Chapter, this means 
		the Local\Sub Chapter field can be changed. For a Sub Unit of a Local , the Sub Unit can be 
		changed. State can also be changed for an Affiliate.	</TD>
