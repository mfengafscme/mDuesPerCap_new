Error Help

This screen will be displayed if the user attempts to access a page they do not have the 
appropriate privileges to access or if an application error has occurred.
<BR/><BR/>

<p>The user should not normally be able to cause an authorization denied error message through 
normal use of the system.  The system hides actions to screens the user does not have access to.  
The error may, however, be caused by bookmarking or caching of links that the user previously 
had access to, or by a malicious user attempting to gain unauthorized access.</p>

<p>If an application error or exception has been detected, detail of the exception will display 
following the error message.</p>
