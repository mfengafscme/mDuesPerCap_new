Selection Criteria Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user the ability to define selection criteria for a query.

<P>The system allows the user to define selection criteria for a query.  
The screen displays all data fields the user previously selected on "Selection Criteria Fields" 
screen.  The user can define selection criteria for each of these fields.  If no fields were 
identified from "Selection Criteria Fields" screen, this screen will not display any fields. 

<p>For each "date" data field, the system shall provide the capability to specify zero or more range selection criteria.</p>
<p>For each numeric data field, the system shall provide the capability to specify zero or more range selection criteria.</p>
<p>The user is able to enter "%" at the end of a selection criterion to indicate a 'begins with' match is to be performed.</p>
<p>For data fields of "date" or "numeric" type, if the user selects anything other than the "between" from the drop down list, the second text box will be disabled. </p>

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>

<p>If the query is saved, "Editable" refers to the ability to change the value provided when the 
query is run from Generate Reports/Generate Mailing Lists.</p> 
<p>If the Criteria contains a dropdown box, options are provided to narrow the scope of the 
result set.</p>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
