<!-- BEGIN CHANGE -->

This screen is used as a basic search mechanism to determine if a Person record already exists 
before adding a new one and is part of the Add flow for all Person-type entities.
<BR/><BR/>

This screen allows the user to enter a First Name, Last Name, Suffix with a dropdown menu, 
a birth date with an optional calendar and Social Security Number. <BR/><BR/>

The Affiliate Identifier-Finder section displays Type (pull down menu), Local/Sub Chapter box to 
be filled in, State/National Type (pull down menu), Sub Unit box to enter data and 
Council/Retiree Chapter box to be filled in. 

<p><b>NOTE: </b>The Affiliate Identifier entered here is not used in the search, but is temporarily 
remembered and redisplayed when the user returns back to this screen after choosing 
the 'Add Member and Continue' action.</p>

<p>The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier search. 
The	Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields must be entered before selecting the Finder link. 
When the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search in a new browser window. 
When a result is selected in that window, the window closes and the selected Affiliate Identifier is 
returned to the original screen and populated in the associated Affiliate Identifier fields. 

<p>All required fields must be entered. <BR/><BR/>

<p>Either 'First Name' and 'Last Name' or 'Social Security Number' is required. <BR/><BR/>
 
The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
