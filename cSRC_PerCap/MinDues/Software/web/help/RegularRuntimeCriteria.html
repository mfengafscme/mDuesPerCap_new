This screen provides the user the ability to define selection criteria on runtime-editable selection 
criteria fields for a report.  The selection criteria fields are defined in the creation
or editing of a report query and the user can provide values in these "editable" fields.

<p>For each "date" data field, the system shall provide the capability to specify multiple selection criteria.</p>
<p>For each numeric data field, the system shall provide the capability to specify multiple selection criteria.</p>
<p>The user is able to enter "%" at the end of a selection criterion to indicate a 'begins with' match is to be performed.</p>
<p>For data fields of "date" or "numeric" type, if the user selects anything other than the "between" from the drop down list, the second text box will be disabled. </p>
<p>The fields are pre-populated with the selection criterion that was set during report creation.</p>
