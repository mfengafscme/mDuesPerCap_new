<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to download a version of the Member Update file for a 
specific Affiliate with Enriched Data.

<BR/><BR/>
This screen has the following "editable" fields: the Affiliate Identifier-Finder section displays 
Type (pull down menu), Local/Sub Chapter box to be filled in, State/National Type (pull down menu), 
Sub Unit box to enter data and Council/Retiree Chapter box to be filled in. 

<p><b>NOTE:</b>The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier 
search. Enter the Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields before selecting 
the Finder link. When the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search 
in a new browser window. When selecting a result in that window, the window closes and the 
selected Affiliate Identifier is returned to the original screen and populated in the 
associated Affiliate Identifier fields. 

<p><b>NOTE:</b>	The affiliate finder can be used to look up affiliates based on the data entered in 
the affiliate identifier fields.  The displayed results can be used to select a single affiliate.  

<p>The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
