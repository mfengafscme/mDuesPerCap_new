that request. The values shown for status are: Denied, In Progress and Check Issued.

<BR/><BR/>

NOTE: The status field is calculated based on the status of the all the Requests and Applications, 
the Roster Status, the Acceptance Code of each Affiliate, and the Check Number, if at least one of the 
Affiliates approved the rebate.

The following Actions (links) may be available from this screen. Remember that the actions that are 
available based on the privileges given to the user.
