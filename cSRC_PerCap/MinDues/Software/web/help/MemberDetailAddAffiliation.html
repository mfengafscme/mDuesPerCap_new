<H1>
Member Detail Add - Affiliation Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user with the ability to create Member Affiliation between a Member or 
Person and an Affiliate. This screen can only be entered from the two paths of either the add action 
on the Member Detail screen or the add action from the Verify Person Results screen called from the 
Add Member path. 

The only editable fields are the Affiliate Identifier and New Comments on this screen. 
The remaining sections are read only. 

<p>The Affiliate Finder is used throughout the site as a simple Affiliate Identifier search. 
The user must enter the Type and either the Local, State, or Council fields before selecting the 
Finder link. Once the Finder link is clicked, the system returns the result of that search in a 
new browser window. When one of the results are selected in that window, the window closes and the 
selected Affiliate Identifier is returned to the original screen and populated in the associated 
Affiliate Identifier fields.

Under the Affiliate View Data Utility(VDU), the affiliate finder will only display affiliates 
found within the Affiliate 	Hierarchy of the VDU user. 

<p>All required fields must be entered. 
 
<p>The Affiliate Identifier must exist in the system.

<p>A member cannot be added to an Affiliate with an Affiliate Status of Deactivated or 
Pending Deactivation or Administrative/Legislative Council.

<p>The Member Type can only be ‘Retiree’ and ‘Retiree Spouse’ if Affiliate Type is ‘R’ 	or ‘S’. 

<p>If the Affiliate Finder functionality is not used to build the fields of the Affiliate 
Identifier and duplicate Affiliates are found for the data entered, the system will display the 
Duplicate Affiliate Identifier Notifier Screen as part of the flow to allow the user to indicate 
the correct Affiliate. Once the choice is made, the flow continues with the requested action.

<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
