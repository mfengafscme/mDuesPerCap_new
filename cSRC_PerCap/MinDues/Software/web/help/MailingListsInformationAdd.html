Mailing Lists Information Add Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

The Mailing Lists Information Add screen lets the user associate a Person or Organization to a 
specific mailing list. If the add is successful, the new mailing list will show up in the Mailing Lists 
Information screen for that Person or Organization. For a Person, select the mailing list. 
For an Organization, select the mailing list, and if relevant, add a number in the bulk count field for 
that Organization on that mailing list. Bulk count is used to identify the number of items to include 
in a bulk shipment. Bulk counts are infrequently used.

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
