This screen provides the user the ability to define the placement order of the selected output 
fields.  This screen will not be available if the user has selected "Count Query" on 
the "Output Fields" screen.

<P>The fields shown are determined by the total number of data fields selected 
on the "Output Fields" screen.  For each field selected in the "Output Fields" screen, 
the user can identify the order to display in the result set.

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>
  
The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
