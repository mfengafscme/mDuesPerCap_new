Phone Number Maintenance Edit Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

The Phone Number Maintenance - Edit screen provides the user with the ability to edit a phone number 
associated with an individual. 

<P>A phone number can be designated as a primary phone number by putting a check in the box 
marked "Primary". 

<P>Using the other check boxes, the phone number can be marked "Private" to indicate that 
this phone number is restricted and only visible to the Department that created it.
"Do Not Call" identifies that the number should not be called and "Bad" indicates that the 
phone number is incorrect. 

<P>The fields that can be edited are Phone Number Code (pull-down), Country Code (pull-down), 
Area Code and the Phone Number itself.  To support international numbers, the Phone Number will be 
stored and displayed in exactly the format in which it was entered.  For example, 
entering "555-5555" will always show the dash while "5555555" will not show a dash.  

<P>To perform any action, the user must have the required privilege set by the Admin functionality.

<P>In addition, the fields Date Created, Created By, Last Updated and
Updated By also display but cannot be edited.

<ul>
	<li>All required fields (marked with an asterisk) must be entered.</li>

	<LI>Required fields are the Phone Number Code, the Country Code and the Phone number.</li>

	<LI>If a phone number is flagged as 'Primary', it overrides the phone number that was 
	previously flagged as 'Primary'.</li>

	<LI>The Area Code is Required if the Country Code is the United States.</li>

	<LI>Only a phone number with Code set to 'Home' can be flagged as 'Primary'.</li>
	
	<LI>Each Department can assign one of their Phone Numbers as the Department's Primary Phone 
	Number.</li>

	<LI>If the Person has been identified as a political objector (see the Political/Legislative screen), 
	then the 'DO NOT CALL' flag is set and locked for all phone numbers.</li>

	<li>If the Person has requested not to be called by AFSCME (see the Political/Legislative 
	screen), then the 'DO NOT CALL' flag is set and locked for the primary home phone number, if one 
	exists.</li>

	<LI>The Affiliate Staff can only update the Primary Membership Home Phone Number.</li>
</ul>
