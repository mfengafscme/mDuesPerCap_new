<TR>

<!-- BEGIN CHANGE -->

The Person Verify Results screen displays information on similar persons who might 
be the same person as the one the user is trying to add, based on the criteria 
entered in the Verify Person screen.  The user can view the results to determine 
if the person trying to be added matches someone already in the database.  If 
not, the user can continue to add the new person.<BR/><BR/>

This screen is used by a number of <U><I>Add paths</U></I> including:
<UL>
<LI>Add Person</LI>
<LI>Add Member</LI>
<LI>Add Affiliate Staff</LI>
<LI>Add Organization Associate</LI>
</UL>

If the user recognizes an existing person as the person trying to be added, the 
user can choose to add a Member or Affiliate Staff using that person or select 
a person to view more information.<BR/><BR/>

This screen will only display if there are Person records in the AFSCME Enterprise 	  	
Application Database which match the search criteria entered on the Verify Person screen.
If no records match, the system will display a Detail - Add screen (which screen depends on 
the type of Add attempted) directly, without first displaying the Person Verify Results screen.<BR/><BR/>

The initial <U><I>Sort</U></I> sequence for records in the result set is (first to last):
<UL>
<LI>Name(Last Name then First Name), ascending alphabetically</LI>
<LI>Affiliate State ascending alphabetically</LI>
<LI>Affiliate Council ascending numerically</LI>
<LI>Affiliate Local ascending numerically </LI>
</UL>
	

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> may be available from this screen. 
<U>The actions available to the user will depend on the privileges that the user has.</U><BR/>

This screen contains column oriented actions for sorting the result set.  
<U>Certain column headers display as links.  Clicking on the link will sort 
the entire result set on that column.</U>  Clicking on the column header the 
first time will sort the results in ascending order based on the column, 
clicking on the same column again sort the results in descending order.  
When sorted in ascending order, a (+) plus sign will appear by the column. 
When sorted in descending order, a (-) minus sign will appear.
