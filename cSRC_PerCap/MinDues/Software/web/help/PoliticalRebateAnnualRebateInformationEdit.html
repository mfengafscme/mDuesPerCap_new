<BR/><BR/>

All required fields must be entered, which includes at least one full Affiliate Identifier.

<BR/><BR/>

The only allowable values for Affiliate Type under Dues Paid To is ‘L’ for Local, ‘R’ for 
Retiree Chapter, and ‘S’ for Retiree Sub Chapter.

<BR/><BR/>

Only one "Approved" Rebate can be processed for a single year. The check will cover 
each Affiliate that the Member has requested a rebate and has been approved by the Affiliate.

<BR/><BR/>

Persons identified by the Affiliate as a Non-Member, have their Acceptance Code automatically 
set to Denied and the Member Status and Dues Type fields are not required.

<BR/><BR/>

If Member Type is set to Union Shop Objector,  Agency Fee Payer, or Retiree Spouse then the 
Acceptance Code is automatically set to Denied.

<BR/><BR/>

If at least one Acceptance Code is accepted by an Affiliate, the Person/Member is flagged as 
eligible for a check. If all Acceptance Codes are denied, the Annual Rebate Status is set to Denied.

<BR/><BR/>

If the Affiliate Finder functionality is not used to build the fields of the Affiliate Identifier and
	duplicate Affiliates are found for the data entered, the system will display the Duplicate Affiliate 
	Identifier Notifier Screen as part of the flow to allow the user to indicate the correct Affiliate. 
	
<BR/><BR/>

If Acceptance Code is set to Council Accepted or Local Accepted, then fields Member Type, Member Status 
and Dues Type are required.  If Acceptance Code is set to Denied, then fields Member Type, Member Status 
and Dues Type can be entered but are not required.
