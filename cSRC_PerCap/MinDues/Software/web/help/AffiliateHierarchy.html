		The Affiliate Hierarchy screen displays the hierarchy of affiliates for the affiliate under which the 
		user entered the Affiliate View Data Utility (VDU). The hierarchy of affiliates starts with the affiliate 
		selected for the View Data Utility and displays all sub affiliates for that affiliate as well as the 
		parents for that affiliate. The user can select to view the affiliate under which the View Data Utility 
		was entered and any sub affiliates of the hierarchy. Other affiliates data can not be viewed and the 
		view link will not be displayed next to these affiliates. To select an accessible affiliate for viewing, 
		select the View link next to the affiliate and the Affiliate Detail screen will display.
