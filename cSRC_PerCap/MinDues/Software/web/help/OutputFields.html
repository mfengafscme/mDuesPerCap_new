Output Fields Help 
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

This screen provides the user the ability to select output fields that will appear in a query 
when the user is adding a new query or editing an existing query.  

<P>There are four sections, Person, Member, Officer and Affiliate, on this screen with each 
containing a pre-determined list of fields. The system provides composite fields of 
"Full Name", "Full Address", and "Full Phone Number" in Person fields and the system provides 
composite fields for "Affiliate Identifier", "Primary Location Address" and "Primary Location 
Phone Number" in the Affiliate fields.

<P>Clicking the heading of each sub section will select/de-select all the fields within that heading.

<p>If the user selects "Count Query", the only output data field for the query is "Count".  
If the "Count Query" is selected, all the data fields on the screen shall be disabled and the 
"Output Fields Order", "Sort Criteria Fields", and "Sort Criteria" links on the top of screen shall 
be disabled on all screens within the wizard chain for the Maintain Queries functionality. </p>

<p>If the "Count Query" is not selected, at least one data field must be chosen before the 
user can proceed to the next step in the activity flow.</p>

<p>For Affiliate fields, only the Primary Location is searched for Address and Phone.  Additionally, 
the Created User ID/Date and Last Updated User ID/Date listed under Affiliate Detail searches 
only for core Affiliate Detail screen modifications which does not include associated affiliate 
information.</p>

<p>The screen retains the user's selection information within a current user session.</p>
<p>If the user is editing a previously saved report, the data fields on the screen are 
pre-populated with the previously saved data.</p>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
