Email Address Maintenance - Edit Help
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

The Email Address Maintenance - Edit screen provides the user with the ability to edit email 
addresses associated with an individual.

<p>The screen displays both primary and alternate email addresses (if known).

<p>The user can designate an email address as "primary" to indicate this is the first choice for 
use, or "bad" to indicate that the email address is incorrect.

<p>The user can key in email address information in both the Primary and Alternate fields.

<p>The system populates the Last Updated and Updated By fields with the current system date/time and 
user ID, respectively, for any email address that was edited. If only one Email Address is 
entered, then it must be marked as Primary. If both are entered, then one of them must be marked 
as Primary.

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on the 
user's privileges</U>.
