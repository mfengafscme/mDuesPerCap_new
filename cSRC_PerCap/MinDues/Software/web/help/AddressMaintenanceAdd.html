Address Maintenance Add Help
</H1>

<BR/><BR/>

The Address Maintenance - Add screen provides the user with the ability to add a new address to 
an individual. Editable fields include address line 1, address line 2, city, 
state (using a pull-down), zip code, county, province and country. NOTE: Required fields are 
identified with an asterisk.

<BR/><BR/>
Using the checkboxes provided, an address can be marked as "bad" to tell the system not to send mail 
to that address; or "private" to indicate that this address restricted and only available to the
department that created it.  A checkbox is also used to designate an address as the "primary" address.
<BR/><BR/>

The following <U>Actions (links or buttons)</U> are available from this screen <U>depending on 
the user's privileges set by the Admin functionality</U>.
