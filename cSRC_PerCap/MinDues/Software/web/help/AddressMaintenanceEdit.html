<BR/><BR/>

The Address Maintenance - Edit screen provides the user with the ability to edit an address 
associated with an individual. 

<BR/><BR/>

<p>An address can be designated as a primary address by putting a check in the box marked "primary". 

<p>In addition, using the appropriate check boxes, the address can be marked "bad" to tell the 
system not to send mail to that address and/or "private" to indicate that this address is restricted 
and only available to the department who entered it.

<p>The fields that can be edited are Mailing Code (pull-down), Address 1 and Address 2, City, 
State (pull-down), zip code (including plus 4), County, Province (if Canada is selected as the 
country) and Country (pull-down). 

<p>To perform any action, the user must have the required privilege, which is set by the Admin 
functionality.

<p>Fields maintained by the system are Date Created, Created By, Last Updated and
Updated By and cannot be edited.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b>  All required fields (marked with an asterisk) must be entered.
<ul><li>	If the Country entered is Canada, the Province is also required.<br>

	<li>	It is required to have at least one Primary Address.<br>

	<li>	Only an address with a Code equal to 'Home' can be flagged as 'Primary'.<br>

	<li>	If an Address is flagged as 'Primary', it overrides the Address that was previously 
		flagged as 'Primary'.<br><br>
</ul>
